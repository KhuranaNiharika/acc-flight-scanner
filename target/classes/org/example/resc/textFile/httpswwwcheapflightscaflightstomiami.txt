Miami airport overview Situated 8 miles (13km) north-west of downtown Miami, Miami International Airport (MIA) is South Florida’s main airport. Due to a vast number of tourist attractions and sizable local populations, it’s one of the largest hubs in the US and acts as the country’s main gateway to Latin America. Having served just fewer than 36 million passengers in 2010, the airport is the 28th busiest in the world, with flights to Miami International Airport coming in from most continents. Unfortunately, though, the airport has a reputation for being slow and disorganized, especially when it comes to luggage procedures. Passengers in transit often miss flights as they are required to clear immigration before collecting their baggage, after which they must then transfer it to their connecting flight. Moreover, it’s common practice for staff to remove bags from carousels and place them on the floor, leaving passengers to crowd around heaps of luggage and compete for a chance to locate theirs. Signage is lacking and unclear, and many airport personnel speak Spanish only. However, MIA has a wide variety of eateries, bars and retail outlets to keep layover passengers amused. Musical performers also provide entertainment throughout the airport’s public spaces and numerous wall paintings add colour and vibrancy to the interior of the terminal building. How long is the flight to Miami? Whether you are flying from Toronto, Vancouver, or Calgary, you’ll find several flight options going to Miami. From Calgary, flights will vary from 7h 53m to 14h 8m. Toronto to Miami offers the shortest flights. If flying out of Toronto Pearson International Airport (the largest airport in Canada) its quickest flight lasts 4h 44m. Out of Vancouver, you can get to Miami in just under 8h. Where can you get direct flights to Miami from? Montreal offers a nonstop flight to Miami aboard American Airlines. It lasts only 3h 43m and departs from Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. Other direct flights are possible from Toronto with Air Canada and American. There are no non-stop flights to Miami from either Vancouver or Calgary. However, you’ll find a number of one-stop flights aboard American, Delta and United. How do you get from Miami International Airport to the city centre? The Metrorail is the most affordable mode of transportation from Miami International Airport to the heart of downtown Miami. You can catch the train on the third floor of the airport, or you can hail a taxi from just outside of the arrival terminal. Another option includes the airport shuttle service which is beyond the doors of the airport’s baggage claim area. Known as the SuperShuttle, this is a shared van service making it a lot more economical than a taxi. However, you might have to make several stops to drop off other passengers which could make the trip a lot longer. If you still prefer to drive yourself, you can also rent a car. Simply catch the shuttle to the rental car center which is just a few minutes away from the main airport. Downtown Miami is less than ten miles from the airport. What are some things to do in Miami? Water sports and outdoor activities such as boating, parasailing, jetskiing, and snorkeling are popular with tourists visiting Miami. While in Miami, you might want to explore the Everglades National Park. You can do this by airboat or you can sign up for a nature walk tour. There is also a Little Havana neighborhood where you can experience Cuban culture including ethnic food, art, and history. With Miami’s lively nightlife, you can also learn to salsa or listen to live music. Do I need a passport or visa to fly to Miami? Although a passport is not required for entrance into the United States from Canada, it is recommended. Travelers without a passport or visa can present an Enhanced Driver’s License or NEXUS card to the airline crew upon boarding. If traveling with a child, be sure to bring their birth certificate with you if you don’t have a passport or NEXUS card for them. How popular are flights to Miami (MIA) this year?
