Overview The Hawaiian Islands, a 2,500km-long archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, are every bit as beautiful as they appear on the silver screen. Millions of tourists takes cheap flights to Hawaii each year for the beaches, natural wonders and more activities than could possibly be packed into one trip. There are six main islands within easy reach of Canadian airports: Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Oahu and Kauai. Perhaps the best island for a first-time visitor is Oahu. Honolulu is the state capital and Waikiki Beach is a must-sunbathe-on. Hawaii (the Big Island) is diverse. Snowcapped mountains give way to sandy beaches and active volcanoes. It has 11 of the world’s 13 climactic zones. Maui is second-largest, home to what are considered to be the best beaches in the world, a favoured destination for whale watching. Kauai is the oldest and most northern island and, some would say, the most beautiful. From the Coconut Coast’s golden sand beaches to the Waimea Canyon, considered the Pacific’s Grand Canyon, it’s a perfect destination for outdoor adventures, while Molokai and Lanai are true paradise islands, offering seclusion and a total getting-away-from-it-all vacation.
