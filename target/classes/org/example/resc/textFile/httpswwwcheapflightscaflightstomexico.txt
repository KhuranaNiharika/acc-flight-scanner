Off Season: The rainy season is generally low season. It runs June to November. Overview Surrounded by three seas, boasting almost 10,000km of coastline and blessed with a fantastic climate, Mexico is one of the most attractive vacation destinations. It’s paradise for almost everyone – sun worshipper, surfer, golfer, culture vulture, and party-goer. Its capital, Mexico City, is a colourful, cultural centre that never seems to slow down. Its resorts are world famous. Cancun on the Caribbean Sea and Acapulco on the Pacific Coast are super resorts, drawing tourists to buy cheap airline tickets to Mexico from around the world. Puerto Vallarta, also on the Pacific, blends a stunning resort setting with an authentically Mexican character. The closest to the U.S., Mazatlan, is known for its laidback vibe and unparalled fishing. The island of Cozumel is considered a top dive destination. Its neighbour on the coast of Quintana Roo, Playa del Carmen, is no slouch when it comes to diving either and is also a popular cruise-ship stopping point. In the south, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo is a perfect mix of a young resort town (Ixtapa) and an old fishing village (Zihuatanejo), while Los Cabos has become a magnet for A-list celebrities, who come to kick back on the Baja California Peninsula. What is good to know if travelling to Mexico? In Mexico City, do not miss Xochimilco, a village with canals and ancient floating gardens that dates back to pre-Aztec times. A popular pastime for families is to hire a boat for a floating canal party. Pack an extra bag on your cheap flights to Mexico City so you can snap up all the bargains you desire. All the smart, high-end stores are in Polanco. The city’s markets offer cheaper buys. The Bazar Sabado (Saturdays) at the Plaza San Jacinto, San Angel, sells arts, crafts and paintings. One of Mexico’s oldest traditions is the bullfight. If you’re in Cancun on a Wednesday afternoon, visit the Plaza de Toros for the folkloric show and bullfight. The plaza also hosts a Mexican rodeo. Whale watchers head to Puerto Vallarta for the humpback calving season between mid-December and early April. April through December are good months to take dolphin-watching tours. In Playa del Carmen, Xcaret is an archaeological site, ecological park and resort often described as a Mayan Eco Disney World. There are several attractions including underground rivers, beach, inlets, butterfly pavilion, and the “Xcaret Mexico Espectacular”. A great place to go sportsfishing is Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo on Mexico’s Pacific Coast. The Pacific Sailfish is the most abundant species in these waters and is available year-round. Blue and Black Marlin swim through between January and July. Dorado or mahi-mahi and yellowfin tuna are make appearances. How long is the flight to Mexico from Canada? Flights from Canada to Mexico vary in duration, depending on the city of origin and the number of stopovers. The average flight duration for direct flights to Mexico is 4h 5m to 5h 0m, depending on the arrival city and route. Travellers need to be careful with Mexico flight deals, as they might end up with a severely longer flight time by saving money on fares. What cities offer direct flights to Mexico from Canada? Direct flights to Mexico from Canada are available from most major cities in the country, including Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Calgary. Air Canada offers nonstop service, as does InterJet and Aeromexico. Direct service is available to Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico City, Cozumel, and Huatulco from multiple departure cities in Canada. What is the best way to travel around Mexico? Camiones, or public buses, are used for transportation everywhere in Mexico, offering easy access to cities, towns, and many villages. Long journeys will find domestic flights available within the country, although prices may be out of the budget for some travellers. Rental cars are an option for travel for those who want to drive the country, but the best places to rent cars are the major cities and tourist areas where roads are well-kept and signed. Quintana Roo, for example, offers a great driving experience for visitors from out of the country. Motorcycles are also available to rent, and bicycle tours are popular in the western part of Mexico. What are some things to do in Mexico? Mexico City offers a glimpse of culture and city life and is the nation’s capital. Guadalajara is home to the blue agave fields responsible for all the tequila that Mexico is known for, as well as plenty of bars and distilleries. Tequila Express offers a tour of the fields with tequila for all passengers. The pyramids of Teotihuacan are also a popular attraction, as are the canals of Xochimilco and the beautiful pools and landscapes of the Yucatan Peninsula. Mayan culture is plentiful throughout the country, as well. Cozumel offers beautiful beaches on the Caribbean Sea, with plenty of restaurants, bars, and other attractions. Tulum, Playa del Carmen, and of course Cancun, cannot be forgotten in your travels, either. Tijuana and the western coast provide lots of nightlife, tourist attractions, and culture, as well. Do I need a passport to fly to Mexico from Canada? Canadian citizens flying into Mexico will be required to present a passport upon entering the country. Passports should be valid for a minimum period of the duration of your stay, although those with longer validity may experience fewer delays and issues in travel. Visas are not required for tourism, but all Canadian nationals must obtain a tourist card when arriving to the country. Airlines provide these cards for all visitors flying into the country, but travelers must ensure this card is stamped and be aware of the permitted duration of stay.
