It started out as a trading post in the 1840s, growing and growing to become the No. 1 business centre in the U.S. Millions of business and leisure travellers take cheap flights to Dallas each year for meetings, conferences, and to sample the city’s exciting culinary scene, lively arts and entertainment districts and superb shopping. Dallas is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to professional sports too. There are three major teams based in Dallas – the Mavericks (NBA) and Stars (NHL) that play at American Airlines Center and the Cowboys (NFL) that call the Texas Stadium home – all followed with passion. There are more than 400 green spaces in Dallas, but its flagship park is Fair Park. It’s a National Historic Landmark, home to museums, performance facilities, a lagoon, North America’s biggest Ferris wheel and Big Tex, a 16-metre-tall statue with a 75-gallon hat and size 70 boots who will even say hello. Search and compare: cheap flights to Dallas Dallas climate Dallas has a humid subtropical climate. Summers are hot and humid, winters are mild. Spring and fall have perhaps the best weather.

Getting around Dallas The main Dallas sights are easy to get to on foot. You can join any of a number of walking tours. Dallas’ public transportation system, the Dallas Area Rapid Transit, also called DART, runs buses and light-rail that connects the downtown Dallas Convention Center with the West End and other sightseeing spots. At the downtown Dallas Museum of Art, you can hop on the M-Line Trolley, also called the McKinney Trolley, to get to the historic McKinney Avenue area. It’s still a good idea to rent a car in Dallas. It’s a very big city, and you’ll be glad you have the option should you decide to spend time outside the city. Make sure you know your hotel’s parking policy though. There’s little free parking to be found downtown, and most hotels charge for parking. You will also have to battle rush hour traffic. The highway numbers are easy to find on a map, but many locals refer to them by name, like the Airport Freeway or Central Expressway. If you’re going to Deep Ellum at night, take a taxi.
