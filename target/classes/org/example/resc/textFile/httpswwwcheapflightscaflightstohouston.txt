Search Deals Everything about Houston underlines its Texas sensibilities: it is big and proud. Much of that chest-thumping attitude is deserved considering that Houston is the oil and gas capital of the US, the fourth-most-populous and second largest city in America boasting the country’s first dome stadium and the greatest concentration of medical institutions in the world. Of course the city also hosts the foremost space centre in the United States. As if these achievements were not enough, Houston is also an attractive, highly liveable and fun city, that is dotted with parks and green spaces and punctuated by off-beat public sculptures and fountains. The first impression visitors get when they step off cheap flights to Houston is the need for much of the local architecture to be big and imposing, the results of this approach can be mixed but nothing ever suffers for a want of trying. Examples include the name of the Texas Children’s Hospital spelled out on its lawn in brightly coloured letters as well as a Mayan pyramid plonked on top of a skyscraper. As for things to do during your visit, consider that you are likely to not do more of what’s on offer than you actually manage. Obvious options include but are not limited to NASA, the rodeo, museums and the Astrodome. Houston climate Houston weather is pleasant starting in the fall through winter and into the spring but beware the summers, which are hot and humid in equally generous measure. Thunderstorms become increasingly frequent as the summer wears on and sometimes result in tornados. The city is also in the path of potential hurricanes so make sure to check the forecast before booking cheap flights to Houston. Winters tend to be mild but infrequent cold snaps have been know to arrive as a result of cold air moving south from the plains. Getting around Houston As long as you’re spending most of your Houston time downtown, you won’t need to rent a car. Houston’s downtown and museum district are small and compact, and many hotels have shuttles to help you get around. The city’s public transportation system is very good. The Metro has both bus and light rail services. If you do decided to venture out, you’ll want to rent a car. Finding your way around shouldn’t be too difficult. The city is smartly laid out, streets are clearly marked and the roads are well kept. The only trouble you’ll have is with traffic. Houston drivers are notoriously ruthless and fast, and you’ll want to stay off the road during rush hour. What is good to know if travelling to Houston? Space Center Houston is the official visitors’ area for the Johnson Space Center, the NASA facility. It’s a huge draw; visitors take cheap flights to Houston from around the US to experience it. Extensive tours lasting up to four hours are available and sometimes feature astronauts in training. Meanwhile the Astronaut Gallery displays several flight suits and features pictures of all astronauts and crews. A combination of films, simulations and interactive displays are all used to impart the sensation of being in space. The Museum of Fine Arts Houston (MFAH) features a noteworthy permanent collection and also includes a sculpture garden. It also hosts outstanding travelling exhibits but is worth a visit for its own architecture, which is a mix of early 20th century traditional and modern styles, including two additions by Mies van der Rohe. Bayou Bend is part of MFAH but the museum house set in 5 hectares of garden is worth a visit on its own merits. It specializes in American antiques, some dating as far back as the 17th century, as collected by Miss Ima Hogg. (As some readers may have feared, this is indeed pronounced “I’m a hog”. The Bayou Bend tour explains how her father, Governor Jim Hogg, gave her the name — and also clarifies that she did not have a sister called Ura – that’s just a Texas tall tale.) As can be expected of a city in Texas, rodeo and livestock-related events here are staged throughout the year, but the big one is the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which takes place in late February and early March. Galveston, a small beach resort town, is just an hour’s drive from Houston. While its beaches are the main attraction, the town also features a fine display of Victorian buildings in its historic district. Interested in cheap flights to Galveston? Here are deals from Toronto to Galveston and Vancouver to Galveston. When is the best time to fly to Houston? Peak Season: The city is best visited any time other than high summer but the best times to take cheap flights to Houston are spring and fall. October and part of November are still warm but without the oppressive humidity that makes the summer months so uncomfortable. Off Season: The majority of tourists steer clear of high summer when the heat matched with humidity make for an uncomfortable setting. How popular are flights to Houston this year? Searches for flights to Houston have seen an increase of 90% this year. What does IAH mean? IAH stands for Houston George Bush Intcntl Airport. Codes like this one are often called IATA codes, a set of identifiers established by IATA (International Air Transport Association) that is widely used by airlines and the aviation industry. While you’re still figuring out your travel plans, it’s not a bad idea to learn the names and codes of other airports around these areas: Houston Hobby Airport (HOU), College Station Easterwood Field Airport (CLL), Beaumont Jefferson County Airport (BPT).
